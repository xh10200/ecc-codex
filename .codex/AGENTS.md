# ECC for Codex CLI

This supplements the root `AGENTS.md` with Codex-specific guidance.

## Model Recommendations

- security-review — Comprehensive security checklist
- tdd-workflow — Test-driven development with 80%+ coverage
- verification-loop — Build, test, lint, typecheck, security

## MCP Servers

Treat the project-local `.codex/config.toml` as the default Codex baseline for ECC. The current ECC baseline enables GitHub, Context7, Exa, Memory, Playwright, and Sequential Thinking; add heavier extras in `~/.codex/config.toml` only when a task actually needs them.

ECC's canonical Codex section name is `[mcp_servers.context7]`. The launcher package remains `@upstash/context7-mcp`; only the TOML section name is normalized for consistency with `codex mcp list` and the reference config.

### Automatic config.toml merging

The sync script (`scripts/sync-ecc-to-codex.sh`) uses a Node-based TOML parser to safely merge ECC MCP servers into `~/.codex/config.toml`:

- **Add-only by default** — missing ECC servers are appended; existing servers are never modified or removed.
- **7 managed servers** — Supabase, Playwright, Context7, Exa, GitHub, Memory, Sequential Thinking.
- **Canonical naming** — ECC manages Context7 as `[mcp_servers.context7]`; legacy `[mcp_servers.context7-mcp]` entries are treated as aliases during updates.
- **Package-manager aware** — uses the project's configured package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun) instead of hardcoding `pnpm`.
- **Drift warnings** — if an existing server's config differs from the ECC recommendation, the script logs a warning.
- **`--update-mcp`** — explicitly replaces all ECC-managed servers with the latest recommended config (safely removes subtables like `[mcp_servers.supabase.env]`).
- **User config is always preserved** — custom servers, args, env vars, and credentials outside ECC-managed sections are never touched.

## Multi-Agent Support

Codex now supports multi-agent workflows behind the experimental `features.multi_agent` flag.

- Enable it in `.codex/config.toml` with `[features] multi_agent = true`
- Define project-local roles under `[agents.<name>]`
- Point each role at a TOML layer under `.codex/agents/`
- Use `/agent` inside Codex CLI to inspect and steer child agents

Core role configs in this repo include:
- `.codex/agents/planner.toml` — implementation planning
- `.codex/agents/architect.toml` — architecture analysis
- `.codex/agents/code-reviewer.toml` — correctness and maintainability review
- `.codex/agents/security-reviewer.toml` — security review
- `.codex/agents/go-reviewer.toml` — Go review
- `.codex/agents/python-reviewer.toml` — Python review
- `.codex/agents/typescript-reviewer.toml` — TypeScript review
- `.codex/agents/database-reviewer.toml` — database review
- `.codex/agents/gan-planner.toml`, `.codex/agents/gan-generator.toml`, `.codex/agents/gan-evaluator.toml` — rapid frontend prototype loop

## Key Differences from Claude Code

| Feature | Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Hooks | 8+ event types | Not yet supported |
| Context file | CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md | AGENTS.md only |
| Skills | Skills loaded via plugin | `.agents/skills/` directory |
| Commands | `/slash` commands | Instruction-based |
| Agents | Subagent Task tool | Multi-agent via `/agent` and `[agents.<name>]` roles |
| Security | Hook-based enforcement | Instruction + sandbox |
| MCP | Full support | Supported via `config.toml` and `codex mcp add` |

## Security Without Hooks

Since Codex lacks hooks, security enforcement is instruction-based:
1. Always validate inputs at system boundaries
2. Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables
3. Run `npm audit` / `pip audit` before committing
4. Review `git diff` before every push
5. Use `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` in config
